# 1000 Days of Distributed Systems Journey

This file will be a log of my personal challenge that consists in **study at least 1 hour of contents related to the _Distributed Systems Roadmap_ every day for 1000 days in a row**.

To achieve this big goal, though, I will incrementally increase the difficulty, with smaller goals.
