## What is this roadmap?

This resource is my personal roadmap in order to become a **Distributed Systems Developer**.

The journey starts with this program, **Distributed Systems Developer Roadmap**, and at the end of it, we will be a proficient Erlang/Elixir developer, with a basic understanding of distributed systems.

We will focus primarily on acquiring a good command of these core tools:

- Elixir (programming language)
- Phoenix (framework)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Ecto (data mapping)

We will also have an introduction to databases using PostgreSQL, as well as some introduction to topics like WebSockets and GraphQL, to name a few.

The content in this roadmap has been extensively curated and only resources that had good feedback from the community and will provide meaningful value to our end goal were added.

> **Obs**: We are not receiving anything from publishers/content creators to indicate those resources.

**Disclaimer**: the order of the resources may change at any time if new resources are published or if it makes sense to change it. We will try to keep the roadmap as stable as possible.
