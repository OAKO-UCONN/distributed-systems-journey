## What is this roadmap?

This resource is my personal roadmap in order to become a **Distributed Systems Engineer**.

Now that you already have a solid and practical knowledge about the main tools we will use to develop our distributed systems, it is time to dive deeper and obtain a more robust knowledge so you will be able not only to participate in the development of distributed systems but actually being able to lead teams and design medium/large distributed systems.

After finish this roadmap, you will have a:

- Advanced knowledge of Elixir;
- Advanced knowledge about tests;
- Advanced knowledge about real-time applications;
- Advanced knowledge about OTP;
- Solid knowledge about how to architect distributed systems;
- Solid knowledge about the BEAM;

> **Obs**: We are not receiving anything from publishers/content creators to indicate those resources.

**Disclaimer**: the order of the resources may change at any time if new resources are published or if it makes sense to change it. We will try to keep the roadmap as stable as possible.

## Duration: 4~5 years

Since the resources listed here need more time to truly master, we can easily estimate that to finish all of them properly we will need a good amount of time.
